   - VATS critical damage or increased hit chance, or decreased AP cost

### MODS
Same mods for both weapons
- Hardened Receiver
- Extended Barrel
- Aligned Stock
- Perforating Magazine
- Reflex Site

## ARMOR
Full set of Unyielding Ultra Light Secret Service
It's not super important what bonuses you get but this is a good place to make up a few bonus Luck points to get your Luck to 33 and get crits once every two shots.

Secret Service underarmor is good for extra carry wieght among other stats, but underarmor is another way to potentially make up a bit of luck if necessary. You can swap in Flannel Shirt and Jeans for an extra luck point.

## BUFFS
Anything that boost AP regen is solid of course (its a VATS built after all)
Company Tea (ap regen)
Mutfruit Juice
Sweetwater Special Blend
Tato Juice (ap boost)
Blight Soup (125% crit damage increase)
Brain Bombs (if you want the extra XP)
Cranberry Relish (again only if you care about the XP)
 
## Notes
Basic Strat: hit VATS, target head, melt enemies.

Not recommended until high level, it requires lots of perks and heavily leverages Legendary Perks to maximize it's output. 

Not the best for soloing bosses but does significant damage, so you can pretty well guarantee rewards in those cases.

Nearly all normal enemies (including legendary scorchbeasts) melt pretty quickly.
