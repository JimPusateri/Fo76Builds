2 variations the first is a bloodied, the second will be a lazier full health with slightly lower damage.
# Bloodied Variant
Nearly impossible to die, and benefits from the damage increase that comes from bloodied.

## Armor
Hellcat Overeaters 
other bonuses not particularly important
Hellcat comes with Ballistic Damage reduction in a set
need at least one piece with cryo resistance

## Weapon
Vampire 50 cal with Vats crits, 25% reduced VATS AP cost (explosive is another viable and potentially better option)
Vampire minigun shredder is a very good melee option when needed

# Lazy Full Health Variant
Impossible to kill, but trades some damage for a lazier style. Damage is still solid though, so it should be enough to stomp through stuff without much thought.

Swapped out "Legendary Endurance" for "What Rads?"

If you're gonna go more melee, swap out travelling pharmacy and Bandolier for Bear Arms and Basher 
toss in a point from perception from gear and you can switch in grenadier 2 
swap in ghoulish for radicool under endurance
you don't need nerd rage under int anymore so you can swap that out to other stats
the int swap should make it possible to switch out action boy and thru hiker for adrenaline 5 and to make room under Luck for bloody mess 3

mutations
added healing factor (this pairs well with rad regen which makes stimpaks basically unnecessary)

armor
on torso, switch in kinetic dynamo to prevent ap hitting the floor when being hit, if it does hit the floor you can drop dodgy for something else

weapon
vampire bashing bayonetted minigun with no ammo
gatlin laser or plasma for some ranged help as needed
