Good survivability and damage output, but loses AP regen and xp bonus oppotunities because of carnivore mutation. One shots most lvl 100 enemies with power strikes. With boosts it can be pushed up to 550+

Legendary Power Armor, aim for a couple pieces with increased Action Point refresh. Which makes the second star important. All other legenday stuff is acceptible as rolled

War Glaive (can go >300 on damage)
AntiArmor (or vampire) with either faster swing speed or more power attach damage
Plasma Blade (energy damage seems to get disproportionate gains from some damage buffs)
