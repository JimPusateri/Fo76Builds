## Mutations
Carnivore
Herd Mentality

## Armor
Legendary Power Armor, aim for a couple pieces with increased Action Point refresh. Which makes the second star important. All other legenday stuff is acceptible as rolled

## Weapon
War Glaive (can go >300 on damage)
AntiArmor (or vampire) with either faster swing speed or more power attach damage
Plasma Blade (energy damage seems to get disproportionate gains from some damage buffs)
