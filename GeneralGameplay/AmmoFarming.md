fo76map.com is gonna be your friend for all ammo material farming. Best ROI is generally to produce it yourself rather than search it out.

### Plasma Cartridges
You're better off making these, so you'll need copper, lead, and plastic.
If you're farming up some xp, you're probably running west tek, you should be able to make enough plastic there by scrapping laser rifles you might pick up. Use Scrapper perk for that.

If you're not interested in West Tek,
- hit up Whitesprings for golfclubs and balls to get plastic
- hit up Hemlock Holes and Dabney Homestead workshops for copper
- farm lead at Flatwoods (hit the weights), or Valley Ski Resort (you're after cannonballs and weights)

With Ammo-smith, Super Duper, and Batteries Included you should be able to put together a solid haul in short order.
