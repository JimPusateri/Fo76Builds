## And How to Get Them
Unfortunately getting a precise mix is nigh impossible in the early without some major patience, or accepting that you'll have some you might not prefer. 

Mutations are gained in two ways:
1. exposure to radiation
2. taking the appropriate serum which can be purchased in the science wing of Modus

If your only option is the first (in the case of not having done the Modus questline yet), you'll have to deal with some trial and error. Exposure to radiation has a chance to assign a mutation chosen at random from the list (with the exception of Herbavore and Carnivore which are mutually exclusive). Further you can only get one mutation per session per server. Curing mutations via RadAway likewise removes a mutation at random. 
This means that you'll have to do some trial and error if you're after a particular mix of mutations. 
This is achieved with a simple loop but can be time consuming
1. join server
2. rad exposure until mutation
3. decision
    - want the mutation? leave server and repeat
    - don't want the mutation? use radawy until the unwanted mutation is gone, then leave server and repeat

If you have done the Modus line, pick and choose to your heart's content.
